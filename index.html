    <p>Bangladesh currently has a population approaching <mark>150 million</mark>
         and will add another <mark> 100 million</mark>
          before stabilizing, unless fertility can soon drop below replacement level.
           This level of fertility decline will require a change in marriage patterns, 
           which have been minimal so far, even with increasing female schooling.
            It would also benefit from a long-awaited shift to long-term contraception.
            . In addition to the consequence of huge population size, the density of
             population is already five times that of any other ‘mega’ country <mnark>(>100 million)</mnark>,
              a very challenging situation for an agricultural society.
               Most of the future growth will be urban, increasingly in
                slums. Numbers of young people will not increase, but
                numbers of older people will increase 10-fold this century,
                 creating a large burden on the health system, especially 
                 for chronic illnesses. High density of population means
                  that agricultural land is virtually saturated, with very 
                  limited capacity to expand food production. Climate change 
                  may have dramatic impacts on agriculture, through flooding
                   and drought resulting from weather changes and geopolitical 
                   influences on transborder rivers. Rising sea-levels and
                    consequent salinity will affect crops and require shifts
                     to alternative land use. Serious long-term planning is
                      needed for meeting the growing needs of the population,
                       both for distribution and consumption.</p>

    <p>The Bangladesh population in mid-2007 was around 147 million.
         The precise figure depends on assumptions about rates of
          growth since the adjusted census figure of 129,247,233 
          for 22 January 2001. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics 
          (BBS) indicates an average rate of natural increase of 
          1.5% annually since the census. However, these figures 
          from the BBS are almost certainly under-estimates of
           crude birth rate (CBR) (20-21/1,000) and crude death 
           rate (CDR) (5-6/1,000). The BBS rates would project a
            population of just over 141 million whereas the Population 
            Reference Bureau (PRB) rate of natural growth of 1.9% per 
            annum is more likely—based on assumed CBR of 27/1,000 and CDR of 8/1,000,
         resulting in a projected population of 147 million.</p>

            <summary>Population projections</summary>
            <p>A more important question is what the future popu- lation growth will be.
             Until the United Nations Population Division (UN PD) released the 2004 revision
             of population projections for all the countries of the world, there was a general
             agreement that Bangladesh would reach 218 million by 2050 and finally stabilize
             at around 260 million in mid-next century (1). However, the 2004 revision by 
             the UN PD proposes a pessimistic upgrading of the 2050 figure to 243 million
             as a consequence of the decade-long fertility plateau (1993–2002). This seems 
            excessively high. The PRB estimate is 231 million for mid-century, which is 
            more realistic, although a new set of Bangladesh population projections 
            should be produced, taking into account the recent demographic events.
            Whatever the details, it can be seen in Figure ​Figure11 that Bangladesh 
            is only halfway along the S-curve of the ‘demographic transition’
             from a historically-stable population size of around 25 million to a
            final size of 10-fold larger. </p>
            <img src="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2740702/bin/jhpn0026-0261_f01.jpg" alt="graph chart">
            <p>
                The UN projection would require an average annual growth rate of 1.29% from today to 2050.
                 As the CDR will not fall below 8/1,000, the CBR would have to remain, on average, at least
                  21/1,000 [The population growth rate (natural increase, not including international
                   migration) is the difference between CBR and CDR, expressed as a percentage, not
                    per 1,000]. This is unlikely as even if the TFR remains at a plateau at 
                    replacement level through 2050, the population-ageing process will bring 
                    the CBR down below 20 within a decade or so. Simultaneously, the population-ageing
                     process will start to push the 
                 CDR beyond 8/1,000 from around 2020, which will further reduce the population growth rate.

            <details>
                <summary>Replacement fertility</summary>
                <p>It is worth noting that the exact year in which replacement fertility is achieved is not of great importance.
                     What is potentially of much greater importance is whether or not fertility can be brought below replacement
                      fertility. For example, if fertility stops declining on attaining replacement level, the final population 
                      will continue to increase for another century and add at least 100 million. However, if fertility declined
                       through replacement (i.e. TFR around 2.2) to the current level of Thailand (TFR around 1.8), the final po

                       pulation could stop 
                    growing at 205-210 million, some 50-55 million lower than otherwise will be the case.</p>
            </details>
<details>
    <summary>Age structure and population momentum</summary>
    <p>A demographic change that has major implications is the rapid fertility decline of the 1980s. The first impact has been to slow population growth,
        but it has resulted in a gradual change in age structure. An encouraging feature of the change to, or ‘ageing’ of the age structure, is the fact that the number of children and young people aged less then 15 years—now at 47 million—will never increase. Throughout this century, that number will remain stable, which should assist planners in building an education system.
         A related feature of this age structure is that, with current low mortality rates, many of those 47 million
          young people will survive and pass through the reproductive years and contribute to the continuing population
           growth, even if replacement fertility level is attained within a decade [Every 5-year delay in achieving 
           replacement fertility adds 3% to the population projection]. To illustrate the significance of this, 
           there are currently about 45 million young women in the reproductive ages (15-49 years). By mid-century,
            this number will have increased to 75 million, as over 90% of young people who survive to age 15 years 
            will survive to age 50 years.

<details>
    <summary>Determinants of future population growth</summary>
    <p>Can changes in any other determinants of population growth play an important role in what future population growth will be in Bangladesh? The major
         components include fertility, mortality, and migration.</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Ageing</summary>
<p>Another less-widely discussed aspect of the ‘ageing’ of the population is the impending massive growth
     of the elderly sector, aged 60 years and over, during this century. Typical of most developing countries,
      the elderly of Bangladesh currently constitute only about one in 20 of the population. However, during
       this century, the current seven million will grow to 65 million, by then accounting for some 26% of the 
       total population (Fig. ​(Fig.3).3). This ‘ageing’ shift has major implications for health as more than 
       half of all deaths occur in this age range.

</p>
<img src="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2740702/bin/jhpn0026-0261_f03.jpg">
<p>It is partly this ageing trend that is triggering the shift from infectious to non-infectious diseases as
     the major causes of death. It is anticipated that, by 2010, non-communicable diseases will account for
      59% of all deaths, up from 40% in 1990. The proportion due to communicable diseases will drop from 51% 
      to 30% over the same period. The remainder is due to injuries, which will increase a little, mainly as
       a result of more road accidents.<br>

    It can safely be assumed that, during this century, a health service system, probably incorporating some form of health insurance, will evolve in response to these new demands. Is this a safe assumption? Who is going to pay for these services, which will inevitably be much more expensive than existing services for most infectious diseases? While the elderly population grows at a rapid rate (2.2% per annum), the working-age population will grow much more slowly, only 0.5% per annum. The effect of this will be that the present dependency ratio will fall precipitously from 11 workers per one elderly person to three workers by 2050 and to two workers by 2100—similar to current Western ratios. Even assuming an effective taxation system in place, the burden on workers to pay for health services will be greatly increased. In the next section, the implications of ageing for health services will be briefly discussed.

<table><tr><td bgcolor="#05E5F3">The United Nations Takes Action</td></tr></table>
<p><i>In 1969, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) was established in order to lead the UN in
    implementing population programs fundamentally based on the notion of family planning, or the “human 
    right of individuals and couples to freely determine the size of their families” without governmental
    interference or legislation. In 1994, at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, Egypt, the designated objectives of the UNFPA were determined in greater depth. It was decided that the UNFPA would specifically focus on the gender and human rights elements of population issues; consequently, the UN Population Fund was granted the lead role in aiding nations in fulfilling the Conference’s Programme of Action.

    The three most significant sections of the UN Population Fund mandate are “Reproductive Health,” “Gender 
    Equality,” and “Population and Development.” The United Nations Population Division (UNPD) works to
     confront the interconnected global issues posed by population growth, which is primarily fueled by
      rising fertility rates, increased longevity, and greater international migration. The UN produces 
      the official demographic approximations and predictions for every country and all regions of the
       world. The UNFPA specifically addresses global population by compiling data and statistics regarding
        migration, fertility, marriage, regional development, urbanization, world population projections,
         and national population policies.
    
    In November 2012, the UNFPA declared family planning a global human right; however, approximately 12 percent of 15 to 49-year-old women internationally are not afforded access to family planning. This is considered an egregious modern-day human rights infringement. The UNFPA aids various UN bodies like the Commission on Population and Development, and endorses the implementation of the Programme of Action undertaken by the International Conference on Population and Development (IPCD) in 1994. The UNFPA has been successful in urging international cooperation on the issue of securing family planning as a human right, pushing the UN to hold three conferences concerning the issue of population, along with two special sessions
     of the General Assembly and a summit in 2019.</i></p>
